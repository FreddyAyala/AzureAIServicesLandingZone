# Azure AI Landing Zone with Terraform

![Azure AI Landing Zone](AIArchitecture.png "Azure AI Landing Zone")

This GitHub repository provides a comprehensive guide and Terraform configurations to deploy an Azure AI Landing Zoneâ€”a specialized environment for empowering AI technologies, including advanced language models like GPT-4. The landing zone is designed to complement existing data management and data landing zones within your cloud-scale data analytics platform, enabling you to unlock the true potential of AI.

## Getting Started

To deploy the Azure AI Landing Zone with Terraform, follow the steps below:

### 1. Set up Connectivity

*   Create a file `/Landing_Zones/terraform.tfvars`.
*   Replace `<your connectivity subscription>` with your actual connectivity subscription ID in the `connectivity_subscription` field.
*   Modify settings in the file `/Landing_Zone/settings.connectivity.tf` based on your requirements.
*   Authenticate to Azure using `az login`.

### 2. Initialize and Preview the Deployment

*   Open your command line interface application and navigate to the `/Landing_Zone` folder.
*   Run `terraform init -reconfigure` to initialize the Terraform repository using local state.
*   Preview the deployment by running `terraform plan -var-file="terraform.tfvars"`.

### 3. Deploy the Connectivity Infrastructure

*   Execute `terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars"` to deploy the connectivity infrastructure for the landing zone.

### 4. Deploy AI Workloads

*   Navigate to the `/Workload/AI` folder.
*   Create a file `/Workload/AI/terraform.tfvars`.
*   Replace `<your connectivity subscription>` and `<your AI subscription>` with your respective subscription IDs.
*   Copy the ID of your hub VNet deployed during the landing zone and paste it in the `hub_vnet_id` field.
*   Follow the same steps as above to deploy the AI workloads.

### 5. Configure APIM

*   Use the provided policy in the README to test OpenAI API behind APIM.
*   Replace `<Your OpenAI API Key>` and `<Your OpenAI Backend Service>` with your actual API key and backend service URL.
<!--
    IMPORTANT:
    - Policy elements can appear only within the <inbound>, <outbound>, <backend> section elements.
    - To apply a policy to the incoming request (before it is forwarded to the backend service), place a corresponding policy element within the <inbound> section element.
    - To apply a policy to the outgoing response (before it is sent back to the caller), place a corresponding policy element within the <outbound> section element.
    - To add a policy, place the cursor at the desired insertion point and select a policy from the sidebar.
    - To remove a policy, delete the corresponding policy statement from the policy document.
    - Position the <base> element within a section element to inherit all policies from the corresponding section element in the enclosing scope.
    - Remove the <base> element to prevent inheriting policies from the corresponding section element in the enclosing scope.
    - Policies are applied in the order of their appearance, from the top down.
    - Comments within policy elements are not supported and may disappear. Place your comments between policy elements or at a higher level scope.

## What's Included

This repository contains Terraform configurations and settings to deploy the following components:

*   Connectivity Components:
    *   Azure Virtual Networks (Hub) for secure connectivity to on-premises systems and other spoke networks.
    *   Azure Firewall, a network-based, stateful firewall to control and inspect traffic flow in and out of the hub.
    *   Bastion, a secure remote desktop access solution for VMs in the virtual network.
    *   Jumpbox, a secure jump host to access VMs in private subnets.

*   AI Workloads:
    *   Azure Open AI, a managed AI service for running advanced language models like GPT-4.
    *   Separate Virtual Networks (Spokes) for securely hosting AI workloads.
    *   Subnets within spokes to isolate different components.
    *   Route Tables for controlling traffic flow within virtual networks.
    *   Application Gateway, a load balancer for secure access to web applications and AI services.
    *   Azure API Management as the API gateway for managing and securing APIs, including Azure Open AI.
    *   Private DNS Zones for name resolution within the virtual network and between VNets.
    *   Cosmos DB, a globally distributed, multi-model database service to support AI applications.
    *   Web applications in Azure Web App.
